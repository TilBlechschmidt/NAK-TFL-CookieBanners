# History of online data privacy in the (+EU) {#sec:history}

At the beginning of the 21st century the world-wide web was a wild-west of tracking and personal data collection. In 2002 the (+EU) took action to counter this development and published the so-called ePrivacy directive (Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002/58/EC). It acknowledged both the importance and usefulness of cookies but also the danger they could pose to a user's privacy [@ePrivacy-2002]. While the directive was designed to make (+opt-in) a requirement it could be interpreted differently, instead allowing (+opt-out).

As a matter of fact, the ePrivacy was only a directive and thus considered a guideline for member states of the (+EU) instead of a mandatory word-by-word legislation that applied. This resulted in many countries interpreting the directive differently: Some countries followed the originally intended notion of opting in while others like e.g. Germany incorporated an (+opt-out) mechanism into their local laws [@tmg-art13]. A few members even considered the browser provided tracking prevention preferences to suffice, treating the installation of a browser by the user as general consent [@ePrivacy-ineffective].

In the following years multiple cases of local law enforcement agencies ignoring this deviation and concerns from users followed [@tmg-opt-out-news]. Close to two decades later the (+ECJ) decided that the german law was not properly following the directive and requested changes [@banner-button-not-sufficient]. To counter these misintepretations of the directive, the (+EU) published a new version (2009/136/EC) seven years later to make the requirement for (+opt-in) more explicit amongst other changes [@ePrivacy-changes] [@ePrivacy-2009; section 66].

While promising, the change did not have the desired effect and member states were still not following the directive as expected [@ePrivacy-ineffective]. However, users were still concerned about their privacy as a number of representative surveys proved. A survey by the University of Pennsylvania from 2009 showed that 87% did not want target advertising based on user tracking [@survey-1]. The following year Gallup found out that 67% thought that behavioural targeting should be outright illegal [@survey-2]. In 2011 a survey by TRUSTe estimated that about 85% of users would not consent to tracking if given the choice and 78% would reject analytics cookies [@survey-3]. The year after, an independent survey showed that 68% are still "not okay" with behavioural advertising [@survey-4]. Despite all this, research by J. R. Mayer et al. uncovered that many websites were still forwarding tracking information without explicit (+opt-in). Not only does this act against the users choice and is considered illegal but it may also harm the users privacy as non-anonymised data is forwarded to third parties [@website-survey].

This did not go by unnoticed and the (+EU) comissioned the (+GDPR) which, as opposed to the ePrivacy directive, was set out to be a regulation to prevent re-interpretations by the members and making the incorporation into local law mandatory [@gdpr-history]. Six years later the regulation was published and taking effect, requiring websites to request explicit consent before enabling any tracking software [@gdpr-recitation-32; section 32].

Even though the (+GDPR) restricts user tracking without explicit consent ((+opt-in)) many websites are ignoring the regulation for a variety of reasons. A non-scientific survey found that up to two thirds of german news websites employ Facebook tracking software without requesting consent. While the source can't be considered reliable, samples taken from sites mentioned in the blog article do reveal that the pages are in-fact using such software without consent. More examples can be found in the list of websites selected for the survey in this paper (see +@tbl:websites). According to a survey by the Ponemon Institute about 40% of companies expected to miss the deadline of the GDPR taking effect to become compliant, while an additional 8% stated that they don't know when and if they will ever reach this state. They discovered that the average annual budget for compliance is about 13 million US dollars, which could explain why many companies are lacking behind [@race-to-gdpr].
