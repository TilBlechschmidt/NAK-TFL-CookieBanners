# Conclusion

- Bogus tasks worked, live feedback from Noah that he was totally confused by the last static question
- A bunch of unaccounted variables like different structures of web-pages
- People are very creative and **will** circumvent whatever you tried to put into place (forced interactions)
  - Use obscure tasks, too many series-junkies knew the answer to the netflix one
  - Make sure people have to at least get past the thing you want to know (someone figured out that inputs aren't validated)
- Tended to interact with top-aligned banners towards the end (task result input is at the top probably)
- Some tried to reject but didn't hit the button properly and gave up (accepted)
  - This could be abused by websites

- Takeaways
  - Only half do interact
  - Half of interactions happen late during the page visit
  - Almost half of the interactions are rejections
  - Contrast matters (Twitter -> Netflix)

- Future work
  - User conditioning?
  - Short-term interaction makes them ignore it?
  - Content density might play a role (fluege.de loader, Netflix vs. Twitter)
  - Colors (independently of size and contrast)
  - Do users who reject also have a high-bar for noticing banners?
  - Does a hard-to-reject site get rejected less?

- Reflection
  - Avoid edge cases (Twitter, fluege.de), differences (forced paths), and foreign languages
  - Not their device, might have been in a "I don't care here" mindset
  - Users were forced to only interact with websites shortly
    - When visiting more frequently they may eventually interact
  - Too many variables, too complicated evaluation (e.g. some conclusions should've incorporated only the initial page load interactions or exclude the forced ones)
  - Scaling is hard using this distribution method (but fine for this application as time is limited anyways)
