# Conclusion

- Bogus tasks worked, live feedback from Noah that he was totally confused by the last static question
- A bunch of unaccounted variables like different structures of web-pages
- People are very creative and **will** circumvent whatever you tried to put into place (forced interactions)
  - Use obscure tasks, too many series-junkies knew the answer to the netflix one
  - Make sure people have to at least get past the thing you want to know (someone figured out that inputs aren't validated)
- Tended to interact with top-aligned banners towards the end (task result input is at the top probably)
- Some tried to reject but didn't hit the button properly and gave up (accepted)
  - This could be abused by websites
